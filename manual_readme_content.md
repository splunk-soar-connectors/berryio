See the [BerryIO](https://github.com/NeonHorizon/berryio) project for more information.

For BerryIO API features that are not supported as part of this app, such as taking an image with
the camera, you can make use of the Phantom HTTP app to perform a generic http post. Just configure
an asset to use the HTTP app with your BerryIO basic auth.

To make this app python3 compatible check
[this](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SOARonprem/5.0.1/DevelopApps/Python3) link.
